# IAS-Multi-Robot-Factory-Navigator
The project is a collaborative effort between the Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) research group in Egypt and the Institute of Automation and Software (IAS) lab at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. It aims to develop a ROS-based architecture for two TurtleBot3 units equipped with Open Manipulator setups designed to navigate the IAS factory.

The primary goal is to control the TurtleBots to follow a sequence of waypoints to perform pick-and-place operations efficiently while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles utilizing onboard LIDAR sensors. Additionally, the onboard cameras enable the manipulators to identify and handle colored objects, streamlining the pick-and-place tasks. This project showcases advanced multi-robot coordination and navigation within a factory setting, emphasizing obstacle avoidance and precise object manipulation.

The project folders are divided into three groups:
1- IAS Lab Simulation Environment 
2- Turtlebot Navigation
3- Open Manipulator Object Handling
