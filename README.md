# IAS-Multi-Robot-Factory-Navigator
The project is a collaborative effort between the Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) research group in Egypt and the Institute of Automation and Software (IAS) lab at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. It aims to develop a ROS-based architecture for two TurtleBot3 units equipped with Open Manipulator setups designed to navigate the IAS factory.
